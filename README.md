# 📊 Machine Learning Model Performance Analysis & Visualization

This project focuses on **building, evaluating, and visualizing Machine Learning models** to understand their performance beyond just numerical metrics.  
The goal is to gain **clear insights using graphs and visual interpretation**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this project, I trained and evaluated Machine Learning models on a dataset and analyzed their behavior using **performance metrics and visualizations**.

The project emphasizes:
- Understanding model predictions visually
- Comparing different ML models
- Interpreting results using graphs instead of relying only on accuracy values

---

## 🧠 Models Used

- Linear Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Lasso Regression  
- Decision Tree (if applicable)

---

## 📈 Visualizations Included

- Model prediction vs actual values  
- Error comparison across models  
- Decision boundaries / performance graphs  
- Metric comparison charts  

These visualizations help in:
- Identifying overfitting and underfitting  
- Comparing model effectiveness  
- Understanding decision-making behavior of models

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - Pandas  
  - NumPy  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- R² Score / Accuracy (based on model type)

---

## 🔍 Key Learnings

- Visualization makes model performance easier to interpret  
- Metrics alone are not sufficient to evaluate ML models  
- Different models behave differently on the same dataset  
- Graphs help in selecting the right model for real-world use cases
